# Expressions

Expressions is a simple script language with the Just-In-Time compilation. It is designed to implement high-performance, customizable ad-hoc components at runtime, such as ranking and sorting functions in database-like systems.

The JIT compiled code will work on x86-64 and AArch64 architectures, including Apple Silicon.

This is a personal and experimental project for implementing proof-of-concept of my ideas. The progress won't be fast since I will use my spare time on this project.
